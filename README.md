# squares-c

For the Chapter 3 lab, we are going to create a program that can generate a square of asterisks.

As before, we have an invite for GitHub Classroom: 




Click on that link and get your repo created, this time there will be starter code in the repo.

Open VS Code and run `git clone` to pull down that repo to your machine.




You will need to write an application that prompts the user to enter the length (1-20) of one side of a square.

Then print out a hollow square of asterisks of the size specified.

Prompt the user to enter 'y' or 'n' to draw another square.

The program would handle lengths of 1-20.




Example output:

    Please enter the length of a side of a square (1-20): 4

    ****
    *  *
    *  *
    ****

    Would you like to draw another square (y/n)? n




The assignment is completed when you have finished and tested the above changes and pushed your code to GitHub for grading.

Remember to push your code you need to "Stage All Changes" -> "Commit Staged Changes" -> "Push"
